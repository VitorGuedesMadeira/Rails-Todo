# Todo List

This is a simple Rails todo list application that I created to practice the basics of Rails and CRUD operations. The application allows users to create, read, update, and delete tasks.

Features:

- Users can create new tasks with a description
- Tasks can be marked as complete or incomplete
- Users can view a list of all tasks, including completed and incomplete tasks
- Users can edit or delete existing tasks

Technologies used:

Ruby on Rails
ActiveRecord
PostgreSQL database
This project was a great opportunity for me to get hands-on experience with the basics of Rails development, including routing, views, and controllers.

Feel free to clone the repository and try the application out for yourself!
